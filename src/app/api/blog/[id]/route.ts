### Corporate Governance
Proper governance ensures your business operates legally and efficiently:
- Board of directors responsibilities
- Shareholder rights and protections
- Officer duties and obligations
- Regulatory compliance requirements

### Contracts and Agreements
Well-drafted contracts are essential for:
- Protecting intellectual property
- Defining business relationships
- Minimizing legal disputes
- Ensuring regulatory compliance

### Mergers and Acquisitions
Understanding M&A law is critical for business growth:
- Due diligence requirements
- Regulatory approvals
- Shareholder considerations
- Post-merger integration

## Best Practices for Business Owners

1. **Consult with Legal Counsel**: Before making major business decisions
2. **Maintain Proper Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all business activities
3. **Stay Compliant**: Regularly review and update your compliance practices
4. **Plan for the Future**: Include exit strategies in your business planning

## When to Seek Legal Help

Contact a corporate attorney when:
- Starting a new business
- Considering mergers or acquisitions
